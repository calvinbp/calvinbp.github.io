    <h2>About Us</h2>
    Bridgeport Inc. was founded in 1982 by Terry Mecham. He has worked in the Portland Metro area for the last 40 years with a focus on precision and quality. Bridgeport Construction emphasizes work for multifamily properties in the area. This includes interior and exterior renovations, disaster remediation, and maintenance. Their amazing work has enabled them to serve many properties for years. (This should probably focus more on the history of the company...the Our Work Section will have more info on the renovations)
